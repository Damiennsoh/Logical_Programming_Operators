# Below are my pseudocode steps as I will be following these steps to write my program in order to dispens the awards according to the award table and it's corresponding time of the three events.

# Design a program that determines the award a person competing in a triathlon will receive.
# creating an event input for all three events- thus swimming, cycling and running
# It also means I will have to add the total time taken by each of the three events.
# I then need to compare the combined total time of each of the three events with the award table provided.
# The time in question is in minutes.
# After comparing the total time taken by the three events with the award table, I can then print out my awards statements based on 
# the combined time of the three events and what award it corresponds to.
# I will be using my if statements to control the flow of the program as well as my decisions.
